# Project Chimera - Meta Specification

## 1. Vision Statement

Project Chimera is an **Autonomous Influencer Network** - a fleet of AI-powered virtual influencers capable of researching trends, generating content, and managing engagement without human intervention.

### 1.1 Mission
Enable a single human operator to manage thousands of AI influencers through a robust, spec-driven infrastructure that ensures quality, safety, and scalability.

### 1.2 Core Principle
> **"Intent (Specs) is the source of truth, Infrastructure (CI/CD, Tests, Docker) ensures reliability."**

**Reference:** SRS Section 1.1, Task 1 Report Section 1 (Research Summary)

## 2. System Boundaries

### 2.1 In Scope
- Trend research and analysis
- Multi-modal content generation (text, image, video)
- Social media publishing (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok)
- Engagement management (replies, comments)
- Agentic commerce (crypto wallet operations)
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval workflows
- OpenClaw network integration

### 2.2 Out of Scope (v1.0)
- Direct live streaming
- Voice/audio influencer content
- Physical merchandise fulfillment
- Legal contract negotiations
- Multi-language support beyond English

## 3. Architectural Constraints

### 3.1 Pattern Constraint
The system MUST use the **FastRender Swarm Pattern**:
- **Planner**: Decomposes goals into tasks
- **Worker**: Executes atomic tasks (stateless)
- **Judge**: Validates quality and safety

### 3.2 Connectivity Constraint
All external interactions MUST use **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:
- Resources for data retrieval
- Tools for actions
- No direct API calls from agent logic

### 3.3 Traceability Constraint
All development sessions MUST have **Tenx MCP Sense** connected for telemetry.

### 3.4 Spec-First Constraint
**No implementation code shall be written without a corresponding specification.**


## 4. Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Requirement | Measure |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Scalability** | Support 1000+ concurrent agents | Load test results |
| **Latency** | High-priority response < 10s | P95 latency |
| **Reliability** | 99.9% uptime for orchestrator | SLA monitoring |
| **Safety** | 0 unapproved sensitive content | Audit logs |
| **Cost** | < $0.10 per content piece | Cost tracking |


## 5. Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibility | Interaction |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Network Operator** | Define campaigns, monitor fleet | Dashboard |
| **HITL Reviewer** | Approve escalated content | Review UI |
| **Developer** | Extend capabilities, deploy MCP servers | CLI, API |
| **Chimera Agent** | Generate content, engage audience | Autonomous |

## 6. Key Decisions Log
